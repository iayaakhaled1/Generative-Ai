# Installation Notes for VS Code and Python Extensions

## 1. Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- Recommended tool for this course.
- Download from the official website by searching **"Install VS Code"** on Google.
- Supports **Windows (8, 10, 11), macOS, and Linux (Debian, Red Hat, Fedora, SUSE)**.
- Select the appropriate version based on your OS and processor (**Intel chip or Apple silicon for Mac users**).

## 2. Install Essential Extensions
### Open Extensions Panel
- Click the **Extensions** button in VS Code or use **Shift + Command + X** (Mac).

### Install Recommended Extensions for Python:
1. **Python Environment Manager** – Helps manage Python environments.
2. **Python Extension Pack** – Contains 7 essential Python extensions:
   - Python IntelliSense (code completion and suggestions).
   - IntelliCode (AI-assisted coding).
   - Python Indent (often included in the pack).
   - Other useful tools for Python development.

### Why These Extensions?
- They enhance code writing efficiency.
- Provide syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and AI-assisted coding.

## 3. Setting Up Visual Studio Code
- After installation, VS Code might not look exactly as shown in tutorials—this is fine.
- Customize appearance if desired, but **functionality is more important**.
- Ensure Python is installed and properly configured.
